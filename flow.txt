Natural Development Flow:

[DONE] Start with basic project setup and window management
    - MLX initialization
    - Window creation
    - Basic cleanup

[DONE] Implement map parsing and validation
    - File extension validation
    - Map file parsing
    - Color parsing
    - Texture path parsing
    - Player position detection

[NEXT] Add basic player movement in 2D (for testing)
    - Implement key handlers
    - Basic movement logic
    - Simple collision detection
    - 2D map display for testing

Implement basic raycasting without textures
